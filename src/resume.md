### Skills

I'm familiar with most current industry tooling and framework choices such as _TypeScript_, _React_ and the great majority of _HTML_ and _CSS_ pre/post-processors. I'm also an advocate for readable, clean code and show it through my constant efforts of standardizing coding styles and knowledge sharing.

### Education
