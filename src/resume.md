# Ethan Miller
My name is Ethan Miller, i am 15 years old in year 10 and a student at [More House School](https://www.morehouseschool.co.uk). 
<br>
Im am currently studdying engineering, dt and computer science at collage.
<br>
I plan on either being a cad engineer or a front end / back end developer. I have a passion for 3d printing and cad design.
<br>
I was diagnosed with [Aspergers syndrome](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/what-is-autism/asperger-syndrome) at the age of 12 and later on was diagnosed with [Dyslexia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dyslexia/) about 2 or 3 months later.
I also love modding things although i mess up a bit, most recently messing up a Onewheel Pint X, This set me and my parents back Â£1.7k ðŸ˜¬. i have a LOT of fun mucking about with pcb's and firmware and even more fun with jailbreaking. For example i RGHed 2 Xbox 360's and Hombrewed a Nintendo 3ds, a nitendo wii and a ps3 slim (although that was with a tool called hen). i have also jailbroken a few iphones, rooted a few nexus 5's and last but not least installed rockbox on a few ipods. Quite the list ðŸ˜†.

### Skills

I'm familiar with most current industry tooling and framework choices such as _TypeScript_, _React_ and the great majority of _HTML_ and _CSS_ pre/post-processors. I'm also an advocate for readable, clean code and show it through my constant efforts of standardizing coding styles and knowledge sharing.
